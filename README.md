Hi, welcome to my github!
Here records my previous works in Data Science and Machine Learning, especially solving business problems with programming tools. I am also very interested in software development (btw I'm also qualified for NYU CS degree requirements!) and data visualization. 

Iâ€™m currently a Master's student in Information Systems at NYU.
Before entering NYU, my previous jobs/projects involves:
<ul>
  <li> Testing and deploying Chinese academic journal search engine from Solr into ElasticSearch/Kibana
  <li> Visualization of academic citation relationship using Neo4j and Python API
  <li> Design, conduct and analyze behavioral Economics researches using JavaScript/HTML, Qualtrics and Amazon MTurk
  <li> Provide data analysis and visualization on the distribution of global venture capital using R (ggplot2) and Python (pandas)
</ul>

I am currently working on projects of NYU Stern course: Data Science in Business (Technical) by Prof. Roger Stein
